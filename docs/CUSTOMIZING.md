# Customizing guide

Everything is editable on the GitHub website: open a file, select the pencil icon, change it, and select **Commit changes**. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for how changes go live.

## Questions and answers

File: `js/questions.js`. Each round has a label, a question and **exactly eight** answers, highest points first. Changing the words on screen only needs this file. A check runs on every change and tells you if a round has the wrong number of answers.

The show title and subtitle used in the browser tab are at the bottom of that file under `SHOW_INFO`.

## Colors

File: `css/style.css`, at the top, under `TOKENS`.

| Setting | What it controls |
| --- | --- |
| `--gold`, `--gold-soft`, `--gold-deep` | Brand color, Team 1, buttons, revealed tiles |
| `--sky` | Team 2 |
| `--ink-950` … `--ink-600` | Background and panel shades |
| `--text`, `--text-muted` | Main and secondary text |
| `--success`, `--warning`, `--error`, `--info` | Status colors (strikes, banners) |

Change a color value there and it updates everywhere. Also update `theme-color` in `index.html` and `manifest.webmanifest` if you change `--ink-900`.

## Text on the screens

File: `index.html`. The title screen text, the "How to Play" rules and button labels are plain text you can edit. The page description and social sharing text are in the `<head>` at the top. Keep the `id="..."` parts of each element unchanged, because the game uses them.

## Fonts

Two lines in `index.html` and `host.html` load the fonts (the `fonts.googleapis.com` link). The font names used are set in `css/style.css` as `--font-display` and `--font-body`. To switch, pick fonts on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com), replace the link with the one Google gives you, and update those two names.

## Logo, icons and sharing image

Folder: `assets/`.

- `favicon.svg` is the logo. Edit or replace it to change the logo everywhere it is used.
- `favicon.ico`, `apple-touch-icon.png`, `icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png` and `icon-maskable-512.png` are the browser tab, iPhone and installed-app icons.
- `og-image.png` (1200 × 630) is the picture shown when the link is shared on WhatsApp, Facebook and similar. Upload a replacement with the same name using **Add file > Upload files** inside the `assets` folder.

The pictures in `docs/assets/` are only used by the README on the repository's front page.

## Motion and sound

Animations switch off automatically for visitors who ask their device for reduced motion. Music and sound effects each have a switch on the game screen.
